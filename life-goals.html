    <h1>LIFE GOALS</h1>
  
    <p>After graduation, I plan on finding a job as soon as possible. Once I do, I can start saving up for future expenses, such as a place of my own. I also want to give back to my parents for helping with so much by giving a portion of my income to them. When I do get a place of my own, I would like also get myself a dog to keep me company. On the side I will like to start marking guitars and basses as a hobby and if possible try to make money off of it.
